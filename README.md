**Protocall:**
Pick out a page from the SJStrongWebsite folder (one with underscores around it because filenames don't like asterisks)</br>
1. Find the html/css/js files </br>
2. Is there a layout file already for that type of page? </br>
Yes? -> You're good to move on to the next step</br>
No? -> Based on those files build a layout in the 'Layouts' folder. Then update the main.CSS for that layout</br>
3. Do you need images/maps/etc.?</br>
Yes? -> Upload those to the assets folder</br>
No? -> You're good to go</br>
4. Build your html file in the pages folder.</br>
5. Does it work? <br>
Yes? -> Remove the files files from the SJStrongWebsite folder
_note: the index.html file also needs to be done. The template for that is \__Home___default_events__.html
